## ðŸŒ±Introduction
PotatoTech is an Android application designed to classify potato leaf diseases. It aims to accurately identify whether a potato leaf is healthy or diseased, specifically detecting Early Blight and Late Blight using machine learning models.

## ðŸ“ŒObjectives
1. Develop a prediction system to identify the health status of potato leaves.
2. Integrate an efficient machine learning model for specific disease detection (Early Blight and Late Blight).
3. Design a user-friendly interface for image submission and health status prediction.

## Data Collection
The dataset used is "[Plant Village - Potato Disease Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjuntejaswi/plant-village)," available on Kaggle. It includes three categories:
   - Healthy Potato
   - Potato Early Blight
   - Potato Late Blight

## Technologies Used
- Details about the technologies and frameworks used in developing PotatoTech.

## Model Architecture
- A brief description of the machine learning model's architecture.

## Model Evaluation and Testing
- Information on how the model was evaluated and tested.
